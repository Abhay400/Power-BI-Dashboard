PROJECT 1 ( ATTRITION DASHBOARD )

HR attrition dashboards provide valuable insights into an organization's turnover rates, reasons for attrition, employee demographics, performance data of departed employees, and the cost of attrition. By analyzing this data, organizations can develop effective retention strategies to reduce turnover and its associated costs.
